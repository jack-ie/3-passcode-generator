## Usage
User clicks "Generate Passcode" and answers the following prompts:
* How many characters for your passcode?
* Would you like UPPERCASE letters?
* Would you like lowercase letters?
* Would you like numbers?
* Would you like special characters?

 For any of these prompts, "OK" registers as "yes" and "Cancel" as "No".

 A randomized input will appear. You can now copy and paste your new random passcode.

 ## Future Development
 #### Will implement checkboxes to apply options for passcode instead of prompts.
